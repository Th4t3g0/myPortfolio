        "description": " Autonomous USVs were developed to detect and corral oil spills in real time, addressing the limitations of traditional booms and skimmers. A leader USV with vision-based perception guides two slave USVs using a “sheepherding” strategy. Image data is processed on a Raspberry Pi, and a Pixhawk controller actuates the thrusters. The system confines oil for treatment while integrating mechanical and electrical design, demonstrating scalable autonomous containment and environmental monitoring.",

Ladder logic was implemented to manage fill and drain operations based on low, mid, and high-level sensor inputs, while an HMI interface was designed to provide real-time level indication, manual and automatic pump control, alarms, and safety interlocks. The system was simulated within TIA Portal to validate control logic and fault responses, with timing refinements ensuring smooth transitions between idle, filling, and draining states to enhance overall stability.",
